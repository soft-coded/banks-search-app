# Banks app
Made with React and courage. Routing done via react-router-dom.

## (Deployed here.)[https://banks-app.netlify.app/]

All the points mentioned in the task can be performed by the app:
* A list of banks from the selected city will be displayed after fetching from the api.
* Search functionality is fully integrated.
* Pagination works good, if I do say so myself. It did take the most time out of these after all.
* Banks can be marked favourite, and can be browsed by favourites. Favourites list persists even after reloading.
* Api calls are appropriately cached and cached values are used.
* Application is deployed (here.)[https://banks-app.netlify.app/]
* And the "extra fun" task: Bank details can be viewed when clicked on the bank ID.

Took me about 2 days (roughly 9-10 working hours) to get the entire thing done. Have to say, it was a pretty fun task.
